    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and
        freezes well, too.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil</strong></li>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It
            can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the
            sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

        <li><strong>Brown the ground beef </strong></li>
        <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it
            is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
        <p>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>

        <strong>
            <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red
            onions).</p>

        <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and
            cook half a minute more.</p>

        <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5
            minutes.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>
            <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
        </strong>

        <p>
            Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and
            tomato paste to the pot.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition,
            to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are
            using.)
        </p>

        <p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.</p>

        <p>
            Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes,
            stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
        </p>

        <p>Remove from heat. </p>

        <strong>
            <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
        </strong>
        <p>
            By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and
            cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire
            cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.
        </p>

        <p>
            When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be
            sticking together.
        </p>

        <p>
            Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet,
            turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from
            sticking together.
        </p>

        <strong>

        <strong>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
        </strong>

        <p>
            In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.
            Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your
            pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta
            cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over
            the top of ricotta cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining
            Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle
            with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.
        </p>

        <strong>
            <li>bake</li>
        </strong>
        <p>
            Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at
            375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.
        </p>

        <strong>
            <li>Cool and serve</li>
        </strong>
        <p>
            Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. May be reheated
            in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from
            touching the sauce.)
